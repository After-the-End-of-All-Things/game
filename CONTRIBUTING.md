# Contributing to ATEOAT!

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute or even being interested in doing so! :+1:

There are a few ways you can contribute:

## Reporting Bugs

Writing up a bug the right way is important! It helps us fix it faster and more efficiently. Here's a few tips on how to do that:

- Use either the Discord #feedback channel or follow the Bug Report template on GitHub.
- Include screenshots of your screen, even if you think it's not relevant.
- Include a way to reproduce your bug. Without this, it's hard to do anything about the bugs.
- If you're running into something that's hard to reproduce, finding a way to do that reliably is very important.
- If you're running into a weird bug that you think might require a lot of explanation, consider making a video of it happening.
- If you're running into a bug related to combat (unable to target, other weird issues), tag a developer in Discord and ask them to pull the combat from the DB for further testing.

## Writing Code

The most obvious way to directly contribute is to write code. You can do this by forking the repository, making your changes, and then submitting a pull request. If you're not sure what to work on, check out the [issues](https://github.com/After-the-End-of-All-Things/game/issues) or the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/After-the-End-of-All-Things/projects/1).

## Creating Content

Creating new monsters, classes, etc is hard work. You can contribute those [here](https://github.com/After-the-End-of-All-Things/content). Some things can even be created using the [Creator Tool](https://creator.ateoat.com)!
